# Resource Policy Demo

This demo showcases how to use `SriovResourcePolicy` to control which SR-IOV Virtual Functions are advertised as Kubernetes resources based on various hardware and configuration criteria.

## Overview

This scenario demonstrates:
- Creating resource policies based on vendor IDs, Physical Function names, and other hardware attributes
- Setting up multiple resource configurations for different network interfaces
- Deploying a pod that uses policy-filtered SR-IOV resources with specific network requirements

## Components

### 1. SriovResourcePolicy
The `SriovResourcePolicy` resource defines which SR-IOV devices should be advertised as allocatable resources:
- **nodeSelector**: Targets specific nodes (`dra-ctlplane-0.dra.lab` in this example)
- **configs**: Defines multiple resource configurations:
  - `eth0_resource`: Filters devices connected to eth0 Physical Function
  - `eth1_resource`: Filters devices connected to eth1 Physical Function
- **resourceFilters**: Specifies filtering criteria:
  - Vendor ID filtering (Intel: `8086`)
  - Physical Function name filtering (`pfNames`)
  - Optional filters for device IDs, PCI addresses, NUMA nodes, and drivers

### 2. Networking Setup
- Creates a dedicated namespace (`vf-test4`)
- Sets up NetworkAttachmentDefinition with SR-IOV CNI configuration
- Configures IPAM with host-local plugin for subnet `10.0.1.0/24`

### 3. Resource Allocation
- ResourceClaimTemplate requests exactly 1 VF from `eth1_resource`
- Uses CEL (Common Expression Language) to filter devices by resource name
- Specifies VfConfig with interface name and network attachment

### 4. Pod Deployment
- Deploys a toolbox pod with network capabilities
- Claims the filtered SR-IOV resource
- Runs with privileged networking capabilities (NET_ADMIN, NET_RAW)

## Usage

1. Remove any catch-all policy that would otherwise claim the same VFs first.
   Policy evaluation is first-match (policies sorted by name), so something like
   `all-devices` prevents `eth0_resource` / `eth1_resource` attributes from being stamped:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n dra-driver-sriov delete sriovresourcepolicy all-devices --ignore-not-found
   ```

2. Apply the resource policy to advertise SR-IOV resources:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f resource-policy.yaml
   ```

3. The DRA driver will discover SR-IOV devices and advertise only those matching the policy criteria
4. Pods can then claim resources using the advertised resource names
5. The pod will be scheduled on nodes where matching resources are available

**Note**: Without a matching `SriovResourcePolicy`, no devices will be advertised (opt-in model).

## Key Features

- **Opt-In Model**: Devices are only advertised when explicitly defined in a policy
- **Granular Filtering**: Filter by vendor, device ID, PCI address, PF name, NUMA node, or driver
- **Multi-Resource Support**: Configure multiple resource types on the same node
- **CEL Integration**: Use Common Expression Language for advanced resource selection
- **Network Integration**: Seamless integration with SR-IOV CNI plugin

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) support
- SR-IOV capable hardware
- SR-IOV Network Operator installed
- Physical Functions (eth0, eth1) configured on target nodes
